Phant is a modular [node.js](https://nodejs.org) based data logging tool for collecting data from
the [Internet of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things).  It is the open source software that powers
[phant.xyz](https://phant.xyz), and was built and originally maintained by [SparkFun Electronics](https://sparkfun.com).

After being decomissioned by SparkFun in late 2017, it was picked up by [Tugzrida](https://github.com/Tugzrida).

Phant is short for *elephant*.  Elephants are known for their remarkable recall ability,
so it seemed appropriate to name a data logging project in honor of an animal that [never forgets](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/elephants-never-forget/).
